        <h1>Welcome to Event Listener </h1>
        <p>Event listener is an app that allow their users to find and create events</p>
        <p>around their current location. An easier way to connect and get to know new friends.</p>
        <p>Event listener was inspired and brought to life by two web developers <a href="https://github.com/WaelAGomaa">Wael Gomaa</a> and <a href="https://github.com/caldera97">David Caldera</a>,</p>
        <p>Who grew up in cities that did not have a lot going on around and their only way to meet new people is by house gatherings.</p>
        <p>We wish that Event listener can makes it easier for everyone out there to let your social butterfly out</p>
